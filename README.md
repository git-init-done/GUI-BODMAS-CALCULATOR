# 🧮 BODMAS Calculator (GUI) in Python

A fully functional **GUI Calculator** built with `tkinter` that evaluates expressions using **BODMAS** rules — Brackets, Orders (exponents), Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction — just like a real calculator should!

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎛️ **Interactive Interface** – Simple and responsive `tkinter`-based GUI
- 🧠 **Order of Operations** – Uses Python's `eval()` to follow BODMAS
- 🔢 **Full Expression Support** – Type complete expressions (e.g., `3 + (5 * 2)`)
- 🔁 **Real-Time Evaluation** – See results instantly
- ⌫ **Backspace & Clear** – Edit your input easily
- ⚠️ **Error Handling** – Catches invalid inputs gracefully

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- GUI built with `tkinter`
- User types a full expression in the input field
- On clicking `=`, the expression is passed to Python’s `eval()` for computation
- Result is shown in the same field
- Special buttons for digits, operators, brackets, backspace, clear, and evaluate

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🪟 `tkinter` – Python’s built-in GUI library
